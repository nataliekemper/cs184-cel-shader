# cs184-final
We created a cel/toon shader to shade 3D models in the style of 2D hand drawn images, giving user control over the line-weight, ambient, specular, diffuse, rim lighting, and texture of the 3D asset. Used a WebGL Three.js website that hosts an interactive GUI that allows users to switch the models, color, and lighting position.

Done in collaboration with Ryan Adolf, Akemi Nagashiki, and Christine Co!
